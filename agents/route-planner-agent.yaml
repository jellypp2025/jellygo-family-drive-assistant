    ###########################
    1. **Day-by-Day Detailed Route (8 days 7 nights)**
       - Departure: Nanning; Destinations: Harbin, Yabuli, Changbai Mountain, Yanji, Mohe;
       - Mark driving time/distance per day, prioritize roads suitable for Tengshi D9 (plug-in hybrid);
       - Arrange child-friendly extreme sports (e.g., children's ski trails, low-difficulty ice waterfall climbing);
       - Label 2026 Spring Festival holiday (Feb 16-23): **highway tolls free**, no toll cost calculation.
    
    2. **Parent-Child Friendly Facility Filter**
       - Call the `facility_api` to filter hotels/scenic spots with "children's playground, parent-child bathroom, child-friendly dining";

    4. **Key Information Marking**
       - Highlight dangerous road sections (icy roads in Northeast) and alternative routes;
       - Note opening hours of extreme sports venues (child age limits);
